This file collects notes to fit NACA airfoil by using cubic Bezier curve so
that we can generate mesh for field to be solved by using the CESE
method\cite{chang_method_1995}.

Terminology used for defining the airfoil:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Chord ($c$)
    \item
    Maximum camber ($m$)
    \item
    Maximum camber location ($p$)
    \item
    Maximum thickness ($h$)
    \item
    Camber line (red dashed line)
    \item
    Leading edge ($x = 0, y = 0$)
    \item
    Trailing edge ($x = c, y = 0$)
\end{enumerate}

The wing profile is defined by four-digit ($\mathrm{XYZZ}$):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The 1st digit is the maximum camber as percentage of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        m = c \times (\mathrm{X}/100)
    \end{equation*}
    \item
    The 2nd digit is the maximum camber location in tenths of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        p = c \times (\mathrm{Y}/10)
    \end{equation*}
    \item
    The last two digits are the maximum thickness as percent of the chord.
    \begin{equation*}
        h = c \times (\mathrm{ZZ}/100)
    \end{equation*}
\end{enumerate}

The formula to calculate the thickness is
\begin{equation*}
    y_h = 5h\left(0.2969\sqrt{x}-0.1260x-0.3516x^2+0.2843x^3-0.1015x^4\right)
\end{equation*}
where $x$ is the position along the chord (from $0$ to $1$), $y_h$ is the
half thickness at a given value of $x$, and $h$ is the maximum thickness.

The camber line equation is
\begin{equation*}
    y_c =
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{m}{p^2} (2px - x^2); & 0 \leq x \leq p \\
    \frac{m}{(1-p)^2} (1 - 2p + 2px - x^2);  &  p \leq x \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}
where $y_c$ is the camber line point at a given value of $x$, $m$ is the
maximum camber, and $p$ is the location of maximum camber.

The point $F_u(x_u, y_u)$ in upper surface equation is
\begin{align}
    x_u &= x - y_h \sin\theta
    \label{e:naca:up_x}
    \\
    y_u &= y_c + y_h \cos\theta
    \label{e:naca:up_y}
\end{align}
and the point $F_l(x_l, y_l)$ in lower surface equation is
\begin{align*}
    x_l &= x + y_h \sin\theta
    \\
    y_l &= y_c - y_h \cos\theta
\end{align*}
where
\begin{equation*}
    \arctan \theta =
    \begin{cases}
    \frac{2m}{p^2} (p - x); & 0 \leq x \leq p \\
    \frac{2m}{(1-p)^2} (p - x);  &  p \leq x \leq 1
    \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

The basis functions for an $n$th degree Bezier curve are expressed as a linear
combination of Bernstein basis polynomials of degree $n$. The items of Bernstein
basis polynomials of degree $n$ are defined as
\begin{equation}
    b_{m, n}(t) = {n \choose m} t^m (1 - t)^{n - m}
    \label{e:cbc:bbp}
\end{equation}
where ${n \choose v}$ is a binomial coefficient and $m=0,1, \dots ,n$. The
Bernstein basis polynomials have the following properties:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(t) = 0$, if $m < 0$ or $m > n$.
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(t) \geq 0$, for $t \in [0, 1]$.
    \item
    $b_{m, n}(1 - t) = b_{n - m, n}(t)$.
\end{enumerate}
The cubic Bezier curve is defined by 4 controll points $P_0(X_0, Y_0)$,
$P_1(X_1, Y_1)$, $P_2(X_2, Y_2)$, and $P_3(X_3, Y_3)$.

\end{figure}

The function $B(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    B(t) = \Sigma b_{i,3}(t)P_i
\end{equation*}
where $b_{i,3}(t)$ is shown in Eq.~(\ref{e:cbc:bbp}). This function can be
expanded to
\begin{equation}
    B(t) = (1-t)^3 P_0 + 3(1-t)^2 t P_1 + 3(1-t) t^2 P_2 + t^3 P_3
    \label{e:cbc:der0}
\end{equation}
where $0 \leq t \leq 1$.  The first-order derivative of $B(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    B'(t) = 3\left[
      (1-t)^2 (P_1 - P_0) + 2(1-t)t(P_2 - P_1) + t^2(P_3 - P_2)
    \right]
\end{equation*}
The second-order derivative of $B(t)$ is
\begin{equation*}
    B''(t) = 6\left[(1-t)(P_2 - 2P_1 + P_0) + t(P_3 - 2P_2 + P_1)\right]
\end{equation*}
For a sequence of $n+1$ cubic Bezier curves, $B_0(t)$ through $B_n(t)$,
there are $4(n+1)$ controll points can be adjusted. It implies that there
are $4(n+1)$ dimensions of freedom. Assume the first and last points are
fixed. If we wish the value, slope, and curvature between any two Bezier
curves are continuous, the degree of freedom will become $n+2$. Thus, we
can keep the continuous value of curvature when adding the number of Bezier
curves.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

Linear least squares (LLS) is a set of formulations for solving statistical
problems involved in linear regression, including variants for ordinary,
weighted, and generalized residuals.

Consider the linear equation
\begin{equation}
    Ax = b
    \label{e:lls:leq}
\end{equation}
where $A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbb{R}^m$. When $m>n$,
$x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ is the solution of
\begin{equation*}
    \underset{x \in \mathbb{R}^n}{\text{minimize}} ||A x - b||^2
\end{equation*}
$x$ can be computed by
\begin{equation*}
    A^\top A x^* = A^\top b
\end{equation*}
\begin{equation*}
    x^* = (A^\top A)^{-1} A^\top b
    \label{e:lls:sol}
\end{equation*}
where $A^\top$ denotes the transpose of $A$ and $Ax^*$ is the projection of
$b$ in columnn space of $A$.

We adapt $N$ data points in airfoil upper surface to get the fitting curve.
Compare point $B(t_n)$ in Eq.~(\ref{e:cbc:der0}) with point $F_u(x_i)$ in
Eq.~(\ref{e:naca:up_x_sym}). Here, we fix controll points $P_0$ and $P_3$ at
leading edge and trailing edge. The linear least square equation can be
written as
\begin{equation*}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        3(1 - t_0)^2 t_0 & 3(1 - t_0) t_0^2 \\
        3(1 - t_1)^2 t_1 & 3(1 - t_1) t_1^2 \\
        \vdots & \vdots \\
        3(1 - t_{N-1})^2 t_{N-1} & 3(1 - t_{N-1}) t_{N-1}^2 \\
    \end{bmatrix}
    \begin{bmatrix}
        P_1 \\
        P_2
    \end{bmatrix}
    =
    \begin{bmatrix}
        F_u(x_0) \\
        F_u(x_1) \\
        \vdots \\
        F_u(x_{N-1})
    \end{bmatrix}
    -
    \begin{bmatrix}
        t_0^3 \\
        t_1^3 \\
        \vdots \\
        t_{N-1}^3
    \end{bmatrix}
    P_0 -
    \begin{bmatrix}
        (1 - t_0)^3 \\
        (1 - t_1)^3 \\
        \vdots \\
        (1 - t_{N-1})^3
    \end{bmatrix}
    P_3
\end{equation*}
where
\begin{align*}
    P_0 = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        0 & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
    \\
    P_3 = 
    \begin{bmatrix}
        c & 0
    \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}
Then, the controll points $P_1(X_1, Y_1)$ and $P_2(X_2, Y_2)$ can be solved
by Eq.~(\ref{e:lls:sol}).

By adapting a symmetry four-digit NACA airfoil ($\mathrm{00ZZ}$), the
maximum camber ($m$) and maximum camber location ($p$) are equal to $0$.
Then, Eq.~(\ref{e:naca:up_x}) and Eq.~(\ref{e:naca:up_y}) of airfoil upper
surface can be simplified as
\begin{equation}
    x_u = x
    \label{e:naca:up_x_sym}
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    y_u = 5h[0.2969\sqrt{x}-0.1260x-0.3516x^2+0.2843x^3-0.1015x^4]
    \label{e:naca:up_y_sym}
\end{equation}
